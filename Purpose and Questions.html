                    We used this project to try and gain some insight into the different areas of the Chicagoland area. 
                    By analyzing the demographics of the different areas we looked to see how they reflected on the public school system. 
                    This research may be helpful for someone looking into living in the city, especially if they have kids who will have to attend a public school.
